<a id="work-experience" class="anchor" href="#work-experience" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Work Experience</h3>

<p>Research - Big Data Research<br>
Worked in a lab researching spatial health analytics. I specifically worked on optimizing Nominatim RDBMS through database tuning so it can do home address to longitude latitude coordinate translation in a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<p>Internship - Software Development<br>
I worked at a software company that sells software to automotive dealerships. I worked with other interns to add a feature to a settings page. This was very involved because it required knowledge of many technologies. I worked on production level code which was shipped to the users. In order for the code to be shipped it had to pass all tests and had to be vetted by other employees. I learned the process of working with enterprise software.<br></p>

<a id="additional-activities" class="anchor" href="#additional-activities" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Additional Activities</h3>

<p>Studied Abroad in Japan - I live with a host family for one month. I studied the Japanese language and the culture during that time.</p>

<p>Eagle Scout Project - I organized and raised money to fund my project. It was an erosion prevention project near a local bay. To prevent erosion it required a wooden retaining wall to be built to prevent soil from running-off into a bay. The project also required clearing low-lying grass and overgrown honeysuckle plants so new plants could be grown to prevent erosion. Certain types of plants that penetrate deep into soil to prevent erosion. </p>
