I hope to solve interesting problems with applications in these fields either researching at a university or working with a company.\r\n\r\n### Interests\r\nElectronics<br/>\r\nCars<br/>\r\n\r\n### People I follow\r\nBill Gates<br/>\r\nElon Musk<br/>\r\n\r\n### Education\r\nStony Brook University, Computer Science BS (May 2017)<br/>\r\nStony Brook University, Applied Math and Statistics BS (May 2017)<br/>\r\nStony Brook University, Computer Science MS (May 2018)<br/>\r\n\r\n### Work Experience\r\nResearch - Big Data Research<br/>\r\nWorked in a lab researching spatial health analytics. I specifically worked on optimizing Nominatim RDBMS through database tuning so it can do home address to longitude latitude coordinate translation in a reasonable amount of time.\r\n\r\nInternship - Software Development<br/>\r\nI worked at a software company that sells software to automotive dealerships. I worked with other interns to add a feature to a settings page. This was very involved because it required knowledge of many technologies. I worked on production level code which was shipped to the users. In order for the code to be shipped it had to pass all tests and had to be vetted by other employees. I learned the process of working with enterprise software.<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Languages\r\nPython<br/>\r\nC<br/>\r\nJava<br/>\r\nSQL<br/>\r\n\r\n### Libraries/Tools\r\nMPI<br/>\r\nIBM DB2<br/>\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\nSuper Computing<br/>\r\nParallel Programming<br/>\r\nRDBMS, NoSQL DB, Map Reduce DB<br/>\r\nOperating Systems<br/>\r\n\r\n### Awards\r\nUniversity Scholar<br/>\r\nDeans list for 4 semesters<br/>\r\nEagle Scout<br/>\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nLinkedin - URL<br/>\r\nnick.contact@email.io<br/>",
